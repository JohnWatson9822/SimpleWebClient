# SimpleWebClient

In this project we are going to develop a simple web client. The main purpose of this project is to learn how client works, how browsers, how windows applications work and to learn to develop one.

This is just a hobby project for learning purpose and might not be full fledge production ready.

We'll be taking very small steps and try to understand the concept. So far the plan is as below:
1. Open and display simple html file.
2. Add a simple http socket client which will make a request and save the response in a html file.
3. Add support for CSS.
4. Add support for HTTPS.
5. Integrade any existing JavaScript engine to support JS.
6. Develop a simple JavaScript engine.

This steps are to make sure we are going in correct way. Each step will be sub devided into many tiny steps to keep it simple, easy to understand/implement and to make sure we don't get exhausted.

Below we'll keep track of steps we've completed/implemented so far and also next step.
1. Developed a simple windows GUI application which display's some text.
2. File handling to load a HTML file.

Thanks
